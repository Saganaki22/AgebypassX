# 🛡️ AgebypassX – Tampermonkey Edition  
Bypass **Twitter/X**'s age restrictions and unlock **sensitive media** — all **without tracking, logging, or compromising your privacy**.

AgebypassX works **100% locally** in your browser. It doesn’t collect data, send requests to external servers, or modify your account.  
Your browsing experience remains **fully private**.

> **⚠️ Important Notice**  
> - You **must use a VPN** and set your **country outside of the UK**.  
> - **Ensure your DNS is not resolving through the UK** — it should be **managed by your VPN**.  
> - **Clear your cookies** and **log out of your X/Twitter session** in the browser **before enabling the script**.  
> - Only tested and verified on **Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera).

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide (Recommended)
1. **Enable a VPN** and set your location **outside of the UK**.

3. **Log out** of your X/Twitter account.  
4. **Clear cookies and cache** in your browser for X/Twitter.  
5. Install **Tampermonkey** (if not already installed).
