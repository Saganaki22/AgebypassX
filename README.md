# 🛡️ AgebypassX – Tampermonkey Edition
Bypass **Twitter/X**'s age restrictions and unlock **sensitive media** — all **without tracking, logging, or compromising your privacy**.

AgebypassX works **100% locally** in your browser. It doesn’t collect data, send requests to external servers, or modify your account.  
Your browsing experience remains **fully private**.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Always enable sensitive media viewing**

- ✅ **Lightweight & fast** → Pure JavaScript, under 5KB  
- ✅ **Live status indicator** (green = active, red = inactive)

## 🔒 Privacy Matters
Unlike other bypass scripts, **AgebypassX**:

## 📸 How It Works
Once installed, a small dot appears at the top-right of the page:
